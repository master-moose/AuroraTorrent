PROJECT: AuroraTorrent
VERSION: 0.1-SCAFFOLD
TODO:
  - Implement DHT node table and get_peers/announce_peer (or integrate crate found by IDE).
  - Piece-level HTTP streaming bridge for play-as-download.
  - UI: exact Spotify replica (sidebar, grid, now-playing footer showing all running torrents).
  - IPC: JSON-RPC over local sockets with StreamPieceRange support.
  - Packaging: add build scripts for .msi, .dmg, AppImage, .deb.
  - Integration tests: engine + in-repo seeder download.
ACTIVE_DECISIONS:
  - Use Tauri + React for quickest polished UI.
  - Selected `mainline` crate for DHT.
  - Streaming must be real (piece-based).
  - Store torrent state encrypted if passphrase provided.
NOTES:
  - User prefers exact Spotify replica and video streaming while downloading.
  - Persist this block as the "pseudo memory.context" for the project.
